{"name":"OpenMD","tagline":"Molecular Dynamics in the Open","body":"OpenMD is an open source molecular dynamics engine which is capable of\r\nefficiently simulating liquids, proteins, nanoparticles, interfaces,\r\nand other complex systems using atom types with orientational degrees\r\nof freedom (e.g. \"sticky\" atoms, point dipoles, and coarse-grained\r\nassemblies). Proteins, zeolites, lipids, transition metals (bulk, flat\r\ninterfaces, and nanoparticles) have all been simulated using force\r\nfields included with the code. OpenMD works on parallel computers\r\nusing the Message Passing Interface (MPI), and comes with a number of\r\nanalysis and utility programs that are easy to use and modify. An\r\nOpenMD simulation is specified using a very simple meta-data language\r\nthat is easy to learn.\r\n\r\nSimulations are started in OpenMD using a single Molecular Dynamics (.md) \r\nfile.  These files must start with the <OpenMD> tag and must have two \r\nsections:\r\n\r\n  1) a C-based <MetaData> section, and \r\n\r\n  2) a <Snapshot> block for initial coordinate and velocity information.\r\n\r\nDetailed descriptions of the structures of these files are available\r\nin the \"doc\" directory.  Sample simulations are available in the\r\n\"samples\" directory.\r\n\r\n###What you need to compile and use OpenMD:\r\n\r\n 1) A good C++ compiler.  We've built and tested OpenMD on the\r\n    following architecture & compiler combinations:\r\n\r\n    Architecture                CXX    Notes\r\n    -------------------------   ----   ----------------------\r\n    Mac OS X 10.9 (intel)       c++    (Apple LLVM version 5.0)\r\n    Mac OS X 10.9 (intel)       g++    (GNU version 4.8.1)\r\n    Mac OS X 10.9 (intel)       icpc   (Intel version 14.0)\r\n    Linux (Ubuntu 13 – x86_64)  g++    (GNU version 4.7.3)\r\n    Linux (RHEL 6.4 - x86_64)   icpc   (Intel version 14.0)\r\n    Linux (RHEL 6.4 - x86_64)   pgCC   (Portland Group version 12.3)\r\n\r\n    OpenMD uses features in the standard template library (STL). Most\r\n    (but not all) C++ compilers support these features.\r\n\r\n 2) CMake, a cross-platform build system which is available at\r\n    http://www.cmake.org     Most Linux and some Unix distributions\r\n    provide CMake as a standard package. If not, please download it,\r\n    and make sure you get a recent version. Mac OS X users can either\r\n    download the CMake installer or install it from the command line\r\n    using macports.\r\n\r\n 3) An implementation of MPI-2 is optional for the single processor\r\n    version of OpenMD, but is required if you want OpenMD to run in\r\n    parallel. We like OpenMPI. Other implementations of MPI-2 might\r\n    work, but we haven't tried.  You can get Open MPI here:\r\n    http://www.open-mpi.org/\r\n\r\n 4) Other optional (but quite useful) libraries that will unlock some\r\n    features of OpenMD:\r\n\r\n      Open Babel:  http://openbabel.org\r\n      Qhull:       http://www.qhull.org\r\n      FFTW:        http://www.fftw.org\r\n      Doxygen:     http://www.doxygen.org\r\n\r\n 5) Some of the utility scripts depend on Python and Perl.  These\r\n    interpreters are common installations on most flavors of Unix and\r\n    Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n###INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n 1) Get, build, and test the required pieces above.\r\n 2) mkdir build\r\n 3) cd build\r\n 4) cmake ..\r\n 5) make\r\n 6) sudo make install\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
